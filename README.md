## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence O6U is a repository for helping my colleagues to practice Prolog.

## Topics

Hare are Some of the notable topics available in this repository:

- [Family relationships](Family-Relationships.pl): Family relationships `Family tree` in Prolog allow us to represent and reason about familial connections using logical rules and facts. By defining predicates like parent(X, Y) and sibling(X, Y), we can create a comprehensive representation of family trees. Prolog's backtracking mechanism enables us to query the family tree and infer new relationships. This provides a concise and logical approach to understanding family dynamics and genealogy.
- [Operations](List-Operations.pl): This file contains the most used operations used in Prolog, such as:
  1. Size of the list.
  2. Get the last element in a list.
  3. Get the max & min values from a list.
  4. Summation of the list.

Feel free to explore each topic directory.
